<p>I have always wanted to do something creative, but was never really sure what to do. The interest to want to do graphic design came from staring at beer can designs while I worked at BevMo. So I did what any sane person would do and decided to put myself in thousands of dollars in debt to get an education and learn design. In this portfolio you will find projects I have worked on while in this class along with my netart that will take you on an adventure. Enjoy.</p>
