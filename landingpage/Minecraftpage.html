<p>I have to admit I have never played Minecraft as much as I did during this class. The building process took longer than I anticipated, but I managed. I had fun building the Wu-Tang logo, for my hiphop heads I'm sure you can appreciate it. The house is not quite finished yet, but who knows if I'll ever go back and finish it.</p>
